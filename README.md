This repository contains the implementation code for paper:

__Motion Direction Awareness: A Biomimetic Dynamic Capture Mechanism for Video Prediction__

## Introduction

![MDANet](/img/overview.png)


MDANet contains an MLP-like temporal module, presenting a new paradigm for efficient video prediction. 

## Over view

* `API/` contains dataloaders and metrics.
* `cls_MD/` is the implement of MD-Translator.
* `model_MD.py` contains the MDANet model.
* `run.py` is the executable python file with possible arguments.
* `core.py` is the core file for training, validating, and testing. 
* `param.py` is the parameter configuration.

## Preparation

### 1. Environment install
We provide the environment requirements file for easy reproduction:
```
  conda create -n MDANet python=3.7
  conda activate MDANet

  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2. Dataset download

Our model has been experimented on the following four datasets:
* [Moving MNIST](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nitish/unsupervised_video/)
* [KTH](https://www.csc.kth.se/cvap/actions/)
* [Human3.6M](http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/description.php) 
* [WeatherBench](https://github.com/pangeo-data/WeatherBench)

We provide a download script for the mm dataset:

```
  cd ./data/moving_mnist
  bash download_mmnist.sh 
```

### 3. Model traning

This example provide the detail implimentation on Moving MNIST, you can easliy reproduce our work using the following command:

```
conda activate MDANet
python run.py             
```
Please note that __the model traning must strictly adhere to the hyperparameter settings provided in our paper__; otherwise, reproducibility may not be guaranteed.

## Resultï¼š

MDANet predicts more accurate actions with less motion blurring compared to other models. Here are some qualitative visualization examples on the KTH dataset:
